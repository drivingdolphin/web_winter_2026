    <p style="color: blue;">Toffee is a male cockapoo dog who is roughly 1 and a half years old. Toffee is very well-behaved and would do anything for his favorite treats. He is very smart and sly, often sneaking into different areas to nab his treats. Due to this, Toffee gets bored easily and requires things to keep him busy, or else he will start tearing down the house.</p>
