        <p style="font-size: large;">Toffee is a very gentle and protective male cockapoo (Cocker Spaniel and Poodle mix) with a large stomach. He doesn't like meeting strangers inside of his "territory" and will bark at them nonstop for 1-2 hours. He seems to think that everyone in the house except for his family is trying to attack his owners, so he acts fearless even though he cowers at the sight of a Rooma robot. Once, a group of troublesome teenage boys came to our front door to pull a prank, but Toffee scared them off because of his ear-shattering barking. Toffee also barks at the neighbors' dogs in the backyard, because our backyard is tangent to 6 other dogs and there is another dog across the street. Toffee's favorite pastime is sleeping, and after that, barking at construction workers or other dogs. Because of this, Toffee is rather notoriously known for his "singing" at sunrise, when he gets all the other dogs to "sing" with him and wake everyone up. </p>
